# Mountain-Climber-Health-Monitoring-and-Prediction-System-using-Fog-Computing-Technology
In this project, a machine learning model and a fog computing model are used to create a health prediction and tracking system for mountain climbers. 
Hardware & Software Specifications 
For the implementation of the project, following things would be used. 

Hardware Requirements 
Laptop/Desktop that supports Windows / MacOS / Android OS / iOS or any other, with minimum 4GB RAM 
Raspberry pi and Arduino 
GPS, GSM, Tempreture and Physiological Signals and Biosensors Sensors
 
Software/Framework/Tools 
Naive Bayes classification 
Python Compiler 
Raspberry pi 

Architecture
The following are the steps involved in building a Naive Bayes model for disease prediction based on symptoms:
1.Import the dataset.
2.Separate the dataset into two parts: training and testing data.
3.Train the Naive Bayes classifier on the training data.
4.Predict the disease based on the given symptoms using the trained classifier.
5.Evaluate the performance of the classifier using testing data.

The fog layer may process and analyse data using a more capable CPU, such as the Raspberry Pi. It may, for example, analyse a mountaineer's health indicators and environmental variables to determine whether they have a risk of high-altitude sickness or hypothermia. It may also track their whereabouts and deliver real-time information about weather and other risks.
The cloud layer can provide enhanced analytics and connectivity, allowing rescuers to connect to the system and obtain data in real time. In the case of an emergency, for example, rescuers may use the Internet of Things (IoT) to identify the climber and check their status before launching a rescue mission. The device can also provide mountain rescue organisations with significant data insights that can be utilised to optimise rescue efforts and improve safety regulations.
